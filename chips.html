                            since these are baked, they taste different from the regular bbq lays. they taste better, less oily and a bit stiffer. sometimes it feels like a small piece might get lodged in your throat, but it’s not too bad so only 1 less point for texture. the flavor is about the same, maybe a tiny bit lighter but it tastes better because it is less oily. the overall experience is pleasant and it is very recommended, just make sure you have some water for after since it makes your throat sweet and dry after.

                            the fantastix texture is a bit weird so it deducts from the overall experience. it is airy and there is a strong corn flavor. the flavor is also not very good: it does taste like chili cheese, but not good, like chili cheese that has been left out overnight and is kinda cold. do not recommend, but if you’re into that type of thing it’s okay.

                            the main difference between baked and non baked cheetos is the chip. baked ones are denser, harder, and have a more stiff flavor. you can taste the corn more. it’s not bad and whether it is better than the original depends on the flavor and your personal preference. in this case, the baked is better than the original, but the flavor drags down the flavor. the artificial cheese flavor is a bit too much, but it is the standard cheeto taste, so if you like that you might like this one. do not recommend.

                            the texture is good, very puffy and is not extra dense in the middle like other puffs. although the flavor is strong artificial cheese, it tastes quite better than a regular cheeto because of the puff, since the puff balances out the flavor more. recommend

                            yum. delicious. great. unrivaled. the main difference between baked and non baked cheetos is the chip. baked ones are denser, harder, and have a more stiff flavor. you can taste the corn more. it’s not bad and whether it is better than the original depends on the flavor and your personal preference. in this case, the baked cheeto pairs nicely with the flavor and they combine to create a delectable snack. although the texture is different, it still tastes good. flamin hot tastes like straight spicy, but salty in a well-rounded way. the taste is the same as a standard hot cheeto, and the texture is similar enough that it tastes pretty similar overall, so if you like those, you may also like this one. yummy. def recommend.

                            very standard. chip is nice, but nothing outstanding. it tastes like ranch: a bit tangy, a bit salty. a very simple go to snack if you are bad at making decisions. recommend.

                            standard. salty cheese powder on a tortilla chip. the flavor is kinda overwhelming because it is really strong. the chip is nice, but nothing special. a typical snack if you don’t like trying new things. recommend.

                            standard tortilla chip, pretty nice. it is sweet but not very spicy. like you can feel it a bit, but not really. it is sweet, similar to sweet and sour sauce if it wasn’t sour. not very good because it's a bit too sweet. do not recommend.

                            these used to taste better, but now they’re a bit saltier, almost to the point where you need to constantly drink water, but it might be case by case. the texture is weird, similar to fantastix, but it is better because they are harder.  they are airy but hard, like there are little gaps inside the chip. the flavor is salted onion, but not strong and not bad, coming from someone who doesn’t like onions. the onion flavor isn’t very strong in most cases and it is good, trust me. recommend.
